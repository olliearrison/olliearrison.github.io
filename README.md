<h1>HexWorld: A Procedural Hex World Island Generator</h1>
HexWorld is an innovative web application developed for the 2025 TartanHacks Hackathon, designed to generate procedurally crafted hexagonal world maps. Whether you're a game developer, digital artist, or storyteller, HexWorld provides a seamless tool for creating immersive landscapes for map-based storytelling, game design, and animation content generation.


HexWorld features an intuitive expandable sidebar that allows users to customize their landscapes with ease. Using the terrain painting tools, you can paint the environment by manually adjusting terrain types. The tree placement tool lets you populate your island with vegetation, creating lush forests or sparse groves to match your vision. For those who prefer a hands-off approach, the dice button at the top enables random island generation, instantly creating a new, unique landscape. If you want a fresh start, the reset button clears the current island, allowing you to begin anew. Additionally, the water level slider on the sidebar provides control over sea levels, letting you submerge or elevate landmasses to shape coastlines and create dynamic environments. Whether crafting a detailed scene or experimenting with procedural generation, HexWorld makes world-building an engaging and flexible experience.


To build HexWorld, we leveraged Node.js for backend functionality and Three.js for rendering, supplementing our own development efforts with powerful frameworks while ensuring a high degree of custom craftsmanship. While Three.js provided a solid foundation for 3D rendering, we designed and implemented many of the UI elements and interactions by hand, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience. A key feature of HexWorld is its use of the Three.js ShaderMaterial class, which gave us fine-grained control over custom material properties. We wrote custom vertex and fragment shaders in OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) to create time-varying materials, allowing for dynamic environmental effects. Additionally, all material textures were uniquely designed, with custom textures crafted specifically for terrain, water, and vegetation. For procedural map generation, we implemented a Simplex noise function, a crucial component in our Turing generation system, which ensures smooth and organic terrain formation. To enhance realism, we also developed a repeating tile texture lookup system that samples 2D noise textures, adding natural variation and depth to the procedural landscapes. Through this blend of existing technologies and our own handcrafted elements, HexWorld delivers a visually rich and interactive map-generation experience.
